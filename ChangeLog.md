## LATEST FEATURES - Version 1.2.0

### Bank Loans - Get Financial Help When You Need It

Need extra funds for your in-game projects? The bank now offers **loans** to help you grow your wealth!

**How It Works:**
- **Borrow Money:** Take a loan from the bank when you're short on cash
- **Collateral Required:** You must have **double the loan amount** in your bank account as security
- **Interest Rate:** Loans come with a **14% interest fee** - so borrow wisely!
- **Easy Repayment:** Pay back your loan anytime using `/bank loan repay`
- **Automatic Reminders:** The bank will remind you every **5 minutes** about your pending loan
- **Late Penalty:** If you don't repay within **7 days**, the bank will deduct the owed amount (plus a **5% fine**) from your wallet or bank balance

> **Pro Tip:** Loans are great for big investments, but make sure you can pay them back!
